# European Central Bank Digital Currency Fraud detection Engine

## What is a CBDC?
A **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)** is a digital form of a country's currency issued and backed by the **central bank**.  
Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized **and government-regulated** and designed to coexist with cash and bank deposits. The CBDC exists to **enhance financial inclusion, improve payment efficiency, and reduce cash handling costs.**

## What this project does
This repository implements an end-to-end production style **fraud detection system** for CBDC, from creating a synthetic dataset for model training to **deploying** the API in docker containerization.
